## Version 1.1.0.0-release - `<Archival>` release

* Released
  * Jul 3, 2016, 5:40:14 PM
  * for Kerbal Space Program 1.1.3
  * by [sarbian](https://github.com/sarbian)

* Fix the typo in useTrimResponseSpeed
* Fix the handling of engine in front of the CoM or rotated
* Add the limitToGimbalRange option.
  * This avoids the engine to move out of its gimbal range when using trim.
  * If you have an engine with a -10 +10 X gimbal range and you trim it by +5 degree you will get a -15 +5 range.
  * This is more realistic that the default mode but lower your control range when you trim.
